I'm a WebSecOps Engineer with 10+ years working across web development, server infrastructure, and website security. Most of my work involves:
- Building and maintaining websites (Magento, WordPress, custom stacks)
- Securing servers, cleaning up hacked sites
- Automating deployment and monitoring with Docker, AWS, and CI/CD tools

I enjoy solving practical problems and keeping systems stable, fast, and secure. Still learning every day.
Always happy to share what I know, and grateful for the knowledge shared here by others.
